I would certainly put “Private Investigator” into that category. The project started with logo development and then branched out from there\n\n![Donna Brown Logo](/images/uploads/db-logo-standard.jpg)\n\nWe ended up working on their Brand Guidelines and establishing consistency across their collateral. The final step in the process was training the client on how to properly use their new brand guidelines and remain consistent in their branding efforts across all platforms\n\n![Donna Brown Collateral](/images/uploads/db-branding-elements.jpg)"
