  "body": "With growing competition for Online Optical Retail, Eyemart needed to find a point of differentiation in the market. Given only six months we had to handle everything from wire framing to testing, new photography styles to in-store experience implementation, and more.\n\nABOUT THE PROJECT\n\nEyemart Express is one of the largest optical retailers in the nation. With nearly 200 stores nationwide and over 25 years of growth, it was time to enter a new arena.\n\nEyeMart tried to implement e-commerce three times before, but were unsuccessful. Given my skill set, I was brought in to implement e-commerce in a new way.\n\nThe first thing we did was identify the largest point of frustration in purchasing glasses online. We found that the prescription form for all optical retailers had the highest abandonment rate. We would focus our e-commerce experience as a CRM effort. Once we have the users prescription saved after a retail purchase, we can link their account and make purchasing glasses easier than ever."
